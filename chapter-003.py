# Tis chapter is about "COMMENTS"
#This is comment
#Comments can be used to explain Python code.
#Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
#Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
# Comments Starts with  " # "
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("WOW a Comment at the end of code Line.JESUS SHIT!!") #DOES YOUR PASHM FALL OFF??


#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

#print("This line wont execute")
print("this will execute!")

'''
You can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

'''
print("so if you use triple qoutes\n '''\n like\n these\n (single qoute)\n ''' \nwill be comment for multi line comment")

"""
THIs
will
works
too!
"""

print('Almost  forget\n """\n these\n (Double qoutes)\n will\n work\n too\n """\n will be comment for multi line comment')
